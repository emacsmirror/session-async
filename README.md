# session-async.el

Package for doing asynchronous processing in Emacs, just like [`async.el`](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async)

Unlike `async.el`, the API for this package provides a separate Emacs session that can stay alive across async calls.

# Why another async processing package?

`async.el` is completely functional and has a lot of track. I never stop recommending it.

I made this package because I use Tramp everyday and using `async.el` is counterproductive because the connection startup overhead takes so long.

Also, check [this discussion about `ob-async` supporting `:session`](https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async/issues/1)

I'd also add that this package is meant for package developers, rather than end user ("devs using Emacs") due to the complexity of maintaining the state of the separate Emacs session.

# Install

Download this code to somewhere wher Emacs can see it. Then load this `session-async.el` file

```elisp
(load-file "~/some/path/session-async.el/session-async.el")
```

# Async usage

This the current interface that tries to mimic that of `async.el`

## session-async-start

    session-async-start START-FUNC FINISH-FUNC SESSION

Execute START-FUNC (often a *quoted* `lambda` sexp) in a separate Emacs session. When done executing, the return value is passed to FINISH-FUNC. Example

```elisp
(session-async-start
 `(lambda ()
    ;; this is executed in a separate process
    (sleep-for 3)
    (cons 222 (emacs-pid)))
 (pcase-lambda (`(,twotwotwo . ,separate-process-pid))
   (message "Async process done, result shoul be 222: %d, and %d â‰  %d"
            twotwotwo
            separate-process-pid
            (emacs-pid))))
```

Differences with `async`:

- If FINISH-FUNC is not provided, it will be set to `'ignore` and once the code is done executed, you won't have any kind of memory leak (buffer, session, process).
- If SESSION is not provided, a one-shot session will be created and destroyed after FINISH-FUNC is called.
- An Emacs session object is returned, not a future value.
- For handling future values, use 

## session-async-future

    session-async-future START-FUNC SESSION
    
Execute START-FUNC (often a *quoted* `lambda` sexp) in a separate Emacs session. Calling this function will return an iterator whose value can be fetched using `iter-next`.

```elisp
(let ((future (session-async-future
               `(lambda ()
                  ;; this is executed in separate process
                  (sleep-for 3)
                  222))))

  (message "I'm going to do some work here") ;; ....

  (message "Waiting on async process, result shoul be 222: %d"
           (iter-next future)))

```

## session-async-new

    session-async-new SESSION-NAME

Create a new session that can be used with several `session-async-future` or `session-async-start` calls.

This wraps an Emacs process running in the background. Be mindful that it will preserve state between `session-async-start` calls. 

Don't forget to shut it down with `session-async-shutdown` or you will have a lingering process.

```elisp
(let ((session (session-async-new)))
  (iter-next
   (session-async-future
    `(lambda ()
       (setenv "SOMETHING" "SOME VALUE"))
    session))
  (message "Current process env value: %s (nil), session: %s (SOME VALUE)"
           (getenv "SOMETHING")
           (iter-next
            (session-async-future
             `(lambda ()
                (getenv "SOMETHING"))
             session)))
  (session-async-shutdown session))

```
## session-async-shutdown

    session-async-shutdown SESSION
    
Shutdown SESSION and kill its corresponding Emacs process.
